This is my first official project! It is going to be the plain old google homepage. I feel excited to be on this journey, although sometimes it is already overwhelming. The future is looking bright! :)
06/28/21 I decided to move on from this project and begin focusing on JS. Bootcamp should be coming up within the next 2 months. A little confused with the git work flow but not concerned. need to separate html and css, start styling after html has been typed, not at the same time. project felt rewarding to work on, but there is still so much to learn im ready to just move on.
